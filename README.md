# Simple Tkinter Password Manager
A password manager application that uses SQLite to store passwords and AES-256 to encrypt them.
The manager is protected by a master password, hashed with Argon2. Tkinter is used to provide the GUI.
The passwords are securely stored in an SQLite database with AES-256 encryption.
